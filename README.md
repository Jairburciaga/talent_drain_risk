# 🚀 Talent Drain Risk AI: Predictive Talent Retention Strategy

### "Turning Employee Data into Strategic Retention Assets"

**Tech Stack:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn) | **Visualization:** Tableau | **Focus:** Predictive Analytics & Business ROI

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary: The Business Need

In today's competitive landscape, **Talent Drain** (Employee Turnover) is not just an HR metric; it is a **critical business risk** and a direct financial drain.

This project deploys an **end-to-end Machine Learning solution** to transform human resources from a reactive function to a **predictive, data-driven strategy**. We identify *who* is likely to leave and *why*, enabling management to intervene proactively before the cost is incurred.

## 💰 Economic Impact & Return on Investment (ROI)

The core value of this project lies in its ability to **quantify risk and justify investment** to key stakeholders:

* **Risk Quantified:** Based on the Center for American Progress's *Cost of Turnover* study, the project calculated an estimated **$2.7 Million annual loss** due to employee turnover in the analyzed sample.
* **Strategic Opportunity:** Data revealed **Sales Representatives** as the highest-risk, highest-impact group.
* **Justified Spending:** The analysis proves that an investment of up to **$37,000** in a targeted retention plan for Sales Reps is **fully covered and justified** by the projected cost avoidance.

## 🛠️ Technical Solution & Methodology

This repository and the included notebook (`TALENT_DRAIN_RISK.ipynb`) demonstrate a robust data science pipeline:

| Component | Key Tools & Techniques |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Science Core** | Python, Pandas, NumPy |
| **Predictive Modeling** | Scikit-learn, **Decision Tree Classifier** |
| **Data Engineering** | One-Hot Encoding (`sparse_output=False`), Domain-aware Imputation |
| **Business Intelligence** | Tableau |

### Technical Highlights

1.  **Explainable ML (XAI):** A **Decision Tree Classifier** was chosen not just for its predictive power, but for its **interpretable rules**. This 'white-box' approach is crucial for HR leadership to understand and trust the model's output.
2.  **Data Quality & Preprocessing:** Demonstrated expertise in correcting common library syntax errors and performing rigorous data cleaning, including identifying and dropping features with low variance (e.g., `Employee Over 18`) and handling complex categorical imputation.
3.  **Flight Risk Profile:** Analysis identified the **typical profile** of a departing employee: **Single**, **low salary**, **high overtime load**, and working in **Sales**.

## 📊 Executive Visualization: Tableau Dashboard

The model's scoring output is seamlessly integrated into an interactive **Tableau Dashboard** to provide C-suite and HR managers with intuitive access to insights.
